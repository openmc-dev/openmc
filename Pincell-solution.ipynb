    "# Modeling a Pincell\n",
    "In this module, we'll demonstrate the basic features of the Python API for constructing input files and running OpenMC. In it, we will show how to create a basic reflective pincell model that is equivalent to modeling an infinite array of fuel pins in a pressurized water reactor. We highly recommend having a copy of the [Python API reference documentation](https://docs.openmc.org/en/stable/pythonapi/index.html) open in another browser tab that you can refer to.\n",

    "We saw before that we could call the `Universe.plot()` method to show a universe while we were creating our geometry. There is also a built-in plotter in the codebase that is much faster than the Python plotter and has more options. The interface looks somewhat similar to the `Universe.plot()` method. Instead though, we create `Plot` instances, assign them to a `Plots` collection, export it to XML, and then run OpenMC in geometry plotting mode. As an example, let's specify that we want the plot to be colored by material (rather than by cell) and we assign yellow to fuel and blue to water."

    "The `openmc.statepoint` object will read information from the `summary.h5` file if one is present, keeping that file open in the Python interpreter. The open `summary.h5` file can interfere with the initialization of subsequent OpenMC simulations. It is recommended that information be extracted from statepoints within a [context manager](https://book.pythontips.com/en/latest/context_managers.html) as we do here. Alternatively, making sure to call the `openmc.StatePoint.close` method will work also. For more details please look to the [relevant section in the user's guide](https://docs.openmc.org/en/stable/usersguide/troubleshoot.html#runtimeerror-failed-to-open-hdf5-file-with-mode-w-summary-h5).   \n",

    "## TRISO Particles\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenMC includes a few convenience functions for generating locations of randomly packed spheres that can be used to model TRISO particles and/or pebbles in a reactor core. To be clear, this capability is not a stochastic geometry capability like that included in MCNP. It's also important to note that OpenMC does not use delta tracking, which would normally speed up calculations in geometries with tons of surfaces and cells. However, the computational burden can be eased by placing random spheres in a lattice.\n",
    "\n",
    "This capability relies on three functions/classes:\n",
    "- `openmc.model.pack_spheres` -- generate locations of random spheres\n",
    "- `openmc.model.TRISO` -- Cell-like object that holds a universe storing the internal structure of a pebble/TRISO\n",
    "- `openmc.model.create_triso_lattice` -- Creates a lattice containing `TRISO` objects for improved tracking performance\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with the `pack_spheres` function. This function takes an outer radius of the spheres, a containing region, and a packing fraction and will return an array of sphere coordinates. For our example, let's use spheres with a radius of 1 cm and a packing fraction of 30%. We'll put our spheres inside of a finite cylinder."

To improve tracking performance, we can use the `create_triso_lattice` function to overlay a lattice that limits how many distance checks need to be performed."
