Building Sphinx Documentation
=============================

In order to build the documentation in the ``docs`` directory, you will need to
have the Sphinx_ third-party Python package. The easiest way to install Sphinx
is via pip:

.. code-block:: sh

    sudo pip install sphinx

Additionally, you will also need two Sphinx extensions for TikZ support and
numbering figures. The sphinxcontrib-tikz_ package should be installed directly
from the git repository as such:

.. code-block:: sh

   git clone https://bitbucket.org/philexander/tikz.git
   cd tikz
   sudo python setup.py install

The Numfig_ package can be installed directly with pip:

.. code-block:: sh

   sudo pip install sphinx-numfig

Building Documentation as a Webpage
-----------------------------------

To build the documentation as a webpage (what appears at
http://mit-crpg.github.io/openmc), simply go to the ``docs`` directory and run:

.. code-block:: sh

    make html

-------------------------------
Building Documentation as a PDF
-------------------------------

To build PDF documentation, you will need to have a LaTeX distribution installed
on your computer as well as Inkscape_, which is used to convert .svg files to
.pdf files. Inkscape can be installed in a Debian-derivative with:

.. code-block:: sh

    sudo apt-get install inkscape

One the pre-requisites are installed, simply go to the ``docs`` directory and
run:

.. code-block:: sh

     make latexpdf
