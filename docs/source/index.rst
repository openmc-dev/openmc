===========================
The OpenMC Monte Carlo Code
===========================

OpenMC is a Monte Carlo particle transport simulation code focused on neutron
criticality calculations. It is capable of simulating 3D models based on
constructive solid geometry with second-order surfaces. OpenMC supports either
continuous-energy or multi-group transport.  The continuous-energy particle
interaction data is based on a native HDF5 format that can be generated from ACE
files used by the MCNP and Serpent Monte Carlo codes.

OpenMC was originally developed by members of the `Computational Reactor Physics
Group <http://crpg.mit.edu>`_ at the `Massachusetts Institute of Technology
<http://web.mit.edu>`_ starting in 2011. Various universities, laboratories, and
other organizations now contribute to the development of OpenMC. For more
