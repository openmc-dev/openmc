===========================
The OpenMC Monte Carlo Code
===========================

OpenMC is a Monte Carlo particle transport simulation code focused on neutron
criticality calculations. It is capable of simulating 3D models based on
constructive solid geometry with second-order surfaces. The particle interaction
data is based on ACE format cross sections, also used in the MCNP and Serpent
Monte Carlo codes.

The development of OpenMC began at the `Massachusetts Institute of Technology`_
within the `Computational Reactor Physics Group`_.
