===========================
The OpenMC Monte Carlo Code
===========================

OpenMC is a Monte Carlo particle transport simulation code focused on neutron
criticality calculations. It is capable of simulating 3D models based on
constructive solid geometry with second-order surfaces. The particle interaction
data is based on ACE format cross sections, also used in the MCNP and Serpent
Monte Carlo codes.

OpenMC was originally developed by members of the `Computational Reactor Physics
Group`_ at the `Massachusetts Institute of Technology`_ starting
in 2011. Various universities, laboratories, and other organizations now
contribute to the development of OpenMC. For more information on OpenMC, feel
free to send a message to the User's Group `mailing list`_.
