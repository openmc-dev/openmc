===========================
The OpenMC Monte Carlo Code
===========================

OpenMC is a Monte Carlo particle transport simulation code focused on neutron
criticality calculations. It is capable of simulating 3D models based on
constructive solid geometry with second-order surfaces. The particle interaction
data is based on ACE format cross sections, also used in the MCNP and Serpent
Monte Carlo codes.

The development of OpenMC is led by the `Computational Reactor Physics Group`_
at the `Massachusetts Institute of Technology`_. For more information on OpenMC,
feel free to contact `Paul Romano`_.
