===========================
The OpenMC Monte Carlo Code
===========================

OpenMC is a community-developed Monte Carlo neutron and photon transport
simulation code. It is capable of performing fixed source, k-eigenvalue, and
subcritical multiplication calculations on models built using either a
constructive solid geometry or CAD representation. OpenMC supports both
continuous-energy and multigroup transport. The continuous-energy particle
interaction data is based on a native HDF5 format that can be generated from ACE
files produced by NJOY. Parallelism is enabled via a hybrid MPI and OpenMP
programming model.

OpenMC was originally developed by members of the `Computational Reactor Physics
Group <http://crpg.mit.edu>`_ at the `Massachusetts Institute of Technology
<http://web.mit.edu>`_ starting in 2011. Various universities, laboratories, and
other organizations now contribute to the development of OpenMC. For more

Forum <https://openmc.discourse.group/>`_.
