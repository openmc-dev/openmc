Obtaining the Source
--------------------

All OpenMC source code is hosted on GitHub_. This means that you will need to
have git_ installed on your computer in order to get source code and updates
directly from the repository. GitHub has a good set of `instructions
<http://help.github.com/set-up-git-redirect>`_ for how to set up git to work
with GitHub since this involves setting up ssh_ keys. With git installed and
setup, the following command will download the full source code from the GitHub
repository::

    git clone git@github.com:mit-crpg/openmc.git

Prerequisites
-------------

In order to compile OpenMC, you will need to have a Fortran compiler installed
on your machine. Since a number of Fortran 2003 features are used in the code,
it is recommended that you use the latest version of whatever compiler you
choose. For gfortran_, it is recommended that you use version 4.5.0 or above.

If you are using Debian or a Debian derivative such as Ubuntu, you can install
the gfortran compiler using the following command::

    sudo apt-get install gfortran

To compile with support for parallel runs on a distributed-memory architecture,
you will need to have a valid implementation of MPI installed on your
machine. The code has been tested and is known to work with the latest versions
of both OpenMPI_ and MPICH2_. You may use older versions of MPI implementations
at your own risk. OpenMPI and/or MPICH2 can be installed on Debian derivatives
with::

    sudo apt-get install mpich2
    sudo apt-get install openmpi-bin

To compile with support for HDF5_ output (highly recommended), you will need to
have HDF5 installed on your computer. The installed version will need to have
been compiled with the same compiler you intend to compile OpenMC with.

Configuration
-------------

All configuration for OpenMC is done within the Makefile located in
``src/Makefile``. In the Makefile, you will see that there are a number of User
Options which can be changed. It is recommended that you do not change anything
else in the Makefile unless you are experienced with compiling and building
software using Makefiles. The following parameters can be set from the User
Options sections in the Makefile:

COMPILER
  This variable tells the Makefile which compiler to use. Valid options are
  gfortran, intel, and pgi.

DEBUG
  Enables debugging when compiling. The flags added are dependent on which
  compiler is used.

PROFILE
  Enables profiling using the GNU profiler, gprof.

OPTIMIZE
  Enables high-optimization using compiler-dependent flags. For gfortran,
  this compiles with -O3. For Intel Fortran, this compiles with -O3 as well as
  interprocedural optimization.

USE_MPI
  Enables parallel runs using the Message Passing Interface. Users should also
  set the MPI_ROOT directory further down in the Makefile.

USE_HDF5
  Enables HDF5 output in addition to normal screen and text file output. Users
  should also set the HDF5_ROOT directory further down in the Makefile.

It is also possible to change these options from the command line itself. For
example, if you want to compile with DEBUG turned on without actually change the
Makefile, you can enter the following from a terminal::

    make DEBUG=yes

---------
Compiling
---------

To compile the code, run the following commands from within the root directory
for OpenMC::

    cd openmc/src
    make

This will build an executable named ``openmc``.
