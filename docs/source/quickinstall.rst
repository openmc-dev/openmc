Quick Install Guide
===================

This quick install guide outlines the basic steps needed to install OpenMC on
your computer. For more detailed instructions on configuring and installing
OpenMC, see :ref:`usersguide_install` in the User's Manual.

--------------------------------
Installing on Ubuntu through PPA
--------------------------------

For users with Ubuntu 11.10 or later, a binary package for OpenMC is available
through a `Personal Package Archive`_ (PPA) and can be installed through the `APT
package manager`_. Simply enter the following commands into the terminal:

.. code-block:: sh

    sudo apt-add-repository ppa:paulromano/staging
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install openmc

Currently, the binary package does not allow for parallel simulations or use of
HDF5_. Users who need such capabilities should build OpenMC from source as is
described in :ref:`usersguide_install`.

-------------------------------------------
Installing from Source on Linux or Mac OS X
-------------------------------------------

All OpenMC source code is hosted on GitHub_. If you have git_, the gfortran_
compiler, and CMake_ installed, you can download and install OpenMC be entering
the following commands in a terminal:

.. code-block:: sh

    git clone https://github.com/mit-crpg/openmc.git
    cd openmc
    git checkout -b master origin/master
    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    sudo make install

This will build an executable named ``openmc`` and install it (by default in
/usr/local/bin). If you do not have administrator privileges, the cmake command
should specify an installation directory where you have write access, e.g.

.. code-block:: sh

    cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/.local ..
