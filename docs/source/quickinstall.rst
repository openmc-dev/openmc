Quick Install Guide
===================

This quick install guide outlines the basic steps needed to install OpenMC on
your computer. For more detailed instructions on configuring and installing
OpenMC, see :ref:`usersguide_install` in the User's Manual.

----------------------------------------
Installing on Linux/Mac with conda-forge
----------------------------------------

`Conda <https://conda.io/en/latest/>`_ is an open source package management
system and environment management system for installing multiple versions of
software packages and their dependencies and switching easily between them. If
you have `conda` installed on your system, OpenMC can be installed via the
`conda-forge` channel. First, add the `conda-forge` channel with:

.. code-block:: sh

    conda config --add channels conda-forge

To list the versions of OpenMC that are available on the `conda-forge` channel,
in your terminal window or an Anaconda Prompt run:

.. code-block:: sh

    conda search openmc

OpenMC can then be installed with:

.. code-block:: sh

    conda create -n openmc-env openmc

This will install OpenMC in a conda environment called `openmc-env`. To activate
the environment, run:

.. code-block:: sh

    conda activate openmc-env

-------------------------------------------
Installing on Linux/Mac/Windows with Docker
-------------------------------------------

OpenMC can be easily deployed using `Docker <https://www.docker.com/>`_ on any
Windows, Mac, or Linux system. With Docker running, execute the following command
in the shell to download and run a `Docker image`_ with the most recent release
of OpenMC from `DockerHub <https://hub.docker.com/>`_:

.. code-block:: sh

    docker run openmc/openmc:latest

This will take several minutes to run depending on your internet download speed.
The command will place you in an interactive shell running in a `Docker
container`_ with OpenMC installed.

.. note:: The ``docker run`` command supports many `options`_ for spawning
          containers including `mounting volumes`_ from the host filesystem,
          which many users will find useful.

----------------------------------
Installing from Source using Spack
----------------------------------

Spack_ is a package management tool designed to support multiple versions and
configurations of software on a wide variety of platforms and environments.
Please follow Spack's `setup guide`_ to configure the Spack system.

To install the latest OpenMC with the Python API, use the following command:

.. code-block:: sh

    spack install py-openmc

For more information about customizations including MPI, see the
:ref:`detailed installation instructions using Spack <install-spack>`.
Once installed, environment/lmod modules can be generated or Spack's `load` feature
can be used to access the installed packages.

--------------------------------
Installing from Source on Ubuntu
--------------------------------

To build OpenMC from source, several :ref:`prerequisites <prerequisites>` are
needed. If you are using Ubuntu or higher, all prerequisites can be installed
directly from the package manager:

.. code-block:: sh

    sudo apt install g++ cmake libhdf5-dev libpng-dev

After the packages have been installed, follow the instructions below for
building and installing OpenMC from source.

-------------------------------------------
Installing from Source on Linux or Mac OS X
-------------------------------------------

All OpenMC source code is hosted on `GitHub
<https://github.com/openmc-dev/openmc>`_. If you have `git
<https://git-scm.com>`_, the `gcc <https://gcc.gnu.org/>`_ compiler suite,
`CMake <https://cmake.org>`_, and `HDF5
<https://www.hdfgroup.org/solutions/hdf5/>`_ installed, you can download and
install OpenMC be entering the following commands in a terminal:

.. code-block:: sh

    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/openmc-dev/openmc.git
    cd openmc
    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    sudo make install

This will build an executable named ``openmc`` and install it (by default in
/usr/local/bin). If you do not have administrator privileges, the cmake command
should specify an installation directory where you have write access, e.g.

.. code-block:: sh

    cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/.local ..

The :mod:`openmc` Python package must be installed separately. The easiest way
to install it is using `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/>`_, which is
included by default in Python 3.4+. From the root directory of the OpenMC
distribution/repository, run:

.. code-block:: sh

    pip install .

If you want to build a parallel version of OpenMC (using OpenMP or MPI),
directions can be found in the :ref:`detailed installation instructions
<usersguide_build>`.
