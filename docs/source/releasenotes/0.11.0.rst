-------
Summary
-------

This release of OpenMC adds several major new features: :ref:`depletion
<usersguide_depletion>`, photon transport, and support for CAD geometries
through DAGMC. In addition, the core codebase has been rewritten in C++14 (it
was previously written in Fortran 2008). This makes compiling the code
cosiderably simpler as no Fortran compiler is needed.

Functional expansion tallies are now supported through several new tally filters
that can be arbitrarily combined:

- :class:`openmc.LegendreFilter`
- :class:`openmc.SpatialLegendreFilter`
- :class:`openmc.SphericalHarmonicsFilter`
- :class:`openmc.ZernikeFilter`
- :class:`openmc.ZernikeRadialFilter`

Note that these filters replace the use expansion scores like ``scatter-P1``.
Instead, a normal ``scatter`` score should be used along with a
:class:`openmc.LegendreFilter`.

The interface for random sphere packing has been significantly improved. A new
:func:`openmc.model.pack_spheres` function takes a region and generates a
random, non-overlapping configuration of spheres within the region.

New Features
------------

- The :class:`Geometry`, :class:`Materials`, and :class:`Settings` classes now
  have a ``from_xml`` method that will build an instance from an existing XML
  file.
- Predefined energy group structures can be found in
  :data:`openmc.mgxs.GROUP_STRUCTURES`.
- New tally scores: ``H1-production``, ``H2-production``, ``H3-production``,
  ``He3-production``, ``He4-production``, ``heating``, and ``damage-energy``
- Switched to cell-based neighor lists (`PR 1140
  <https://github.com/openmc-dev/openmc/pull/1140>`_)
- Two new probability distributions that can be used for source distributions:
  :class:`openmc.stats.Normal` and :class:`openmc.stats.Muir`
- The :mod:`openmc.data` module now supports reading and sampling from ENDF File
  32 resonance covariance data (`PR 1024
  <https://github.com/openmc-dev/openmc/pull/1024>`_).
