Summary
-------

This release of OpenMC is primarily a hotfix release with numerous important bug
fixes. Several tally-related enhancements have also been added.

------------
New Features
------------

Three tally-related enhancements were added to the code in this release:

- A new :class:`~openmc.CollisionFilter` class that allows tallies to be filtered
  by the number of collisions a particle has undergone.
- A `translation` attribute has been added to :class:`~openmc.MeshFilter` that
  allows a mesh to be translated from its original position before location
  checks are performed.
- The :class:`~openmc.UnstructuredMesh` class now supports libMesh unstructured
  meshes to enable better ingration with MOOSE-based applications.
