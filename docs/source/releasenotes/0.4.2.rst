===================
What's New in 0.4.2
===================

-------------------
System Requirements
-------------------

There are no special requirements for running the OpenMC code. As of this
release, OpenMC has been tested on a variety of Linux distributions, Mac OS X,
and Microsoft Windows 7. Memory requirements will vary depending on the size of
the problem at hand (mostly on the number of nuclides in the problem).

------------
New Features
------------

- Ability to specify void materials.
- Option to not reduce tallies across processors at end of each batch.
- Uniform fission site method for reducing variance on local tallies.
- Reading/writing binary source files.
- Added more messages for <trace> or high verbosity.
- Estimator for diffusion coefficient.
- Ability to specify 'point' source type.
- Ability to change random number seed.
- Users can now specify units='sum' on a <density> tag. This tells the code that
  the total material density is the sum of the atom fractions listed for each
  nuclide on the material.
