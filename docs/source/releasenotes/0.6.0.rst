===================
What's New in 0.6.0
===================

System Requirements
-------------------

There are no special requirements for running the OpenMC code. As of this
release, OpenMC has been tested on a variety of Linux distributions, Mac OS X,
and Microsoft Windows 7. Memory requirements will vary depending on the size of
the problem at hand (mostly on the number of nuclides in the problem).

- Support for older cross sections (e.g. MCNP 66c)
- Progress bar for plots
- Expanded support for natural elements via <natural_elements> in settings.xml
