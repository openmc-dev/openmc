===================
What's New in 0.6.1
===================

-------------------
System Requirements
-------------------

There are no special requirements for running the OpenMC code. As of this
release, OpenMC has been tested on a variety of Linux distributions, Mac OS X,
and Microsoft Windows 7. Memory requirements will vary depending on the size of
the problem at hand (mostly on the number of nuclides in the problem).

------------
New Features
------------

- Coarse mesh finite difference (CMFD) acceleration no longer requires PETSc
- Statepoint file numbering is now zero-padded
- Python scripts now compatible with Python 2 or 3
- Ability to run particle restarts in fixed source calculations
- Capability to filter box source by fissionable materials
- Nuclide/element names are now case insensitive in input files
- Improved treatment of resonance scattering for heavy nuclides
