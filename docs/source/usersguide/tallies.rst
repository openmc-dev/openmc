==================
Specifying Tallies
==================

.. currentmodule:: openmc

In order to obtain estimates of physical quantities in your simulation, you need
to create one or more tallies using the :class:`openmc.Tally` class. As
explained in detail in the :ref:`theory manual <methods_tallies>`, tallies
provide estimates of a scoring function times the flux integrated over some
region of phase space, as in:

.. math::

    X = \underbrace{\int d\mathbf{r} \int d\mathbf{\Omega} \int
    dE}_{\text{filters}} \underbrace{f(\mathbf{r}, \mathbf{\Omega},
    E)}_{\text{scores}} \psi (\mathbf{r}, \mathbf{\Omega}, E)

Thus, to specify a tally, we need to specify what regions of phase space should
be included when deciding whether to score an event as well as what the scoring
function (:math:`f` in the above equation) should be used. The regions of phase
space are generally called *filters* and the scoring functions are simply
called *scores*.

The only cases when filters do not correspond directly with the regions of
phase space are when expansion functions are applied in the integrand, such as
for Legendre expansions of the scattering kernel.

-------
Filters
-------

To specify the regions of phase space, one must create a
:class:`openmc.Filter`. Since :class:`openmc.Filter` is an abstract class, you
actually need to instantiate one of its sub-classes (for a full listing, see
:ref:`pythonapi_tallies`). For example, to indicate that events that occur in a
given cell should score to the tally, we would create a
:class:`openmc.CellFilter`::

   cell_filter = openmc.CellFilter([fuel.id, moderator.id, reflector.id])

Another commonly used filter is :class:`openmc.EnergyFilter`, which specifies
multiple energy bins over which events should be scored. Thus, if we wanted to
tally events where the incident particle has an energy in the ranges [0 eV, 4
eV] and [4 eV, 1 MeV], we would do the following::

  energy_filter = openmc.EnergyFilter([0.0, 4.0, 1.0e6])

Energies are specified in eV and need to be monotonically increasing.

.. caution:: An energy bin between zero and the lowest energy specified is not
             included by default as it is in MCNP.

Once you have created a filter, it should be assigned to a :class:`openmc.Tally`
instance through the :attr:`Tally.filters` attribute::

  tally.filters.append(cell_filter)
  tally.filters.append(energy_filter)

  # This is equivalent
  tally.filters = [cell_filter, energy_filter]

.. note:: You are actually not required to assign any filters to a tally. If you
          create a tally with no filters, all events will score to the
          tally. This can be useful if you want to know, for example, a reaction
          rate over your entire model.

.. _usersguide_scores:

------
Scores
------

To specify the scoring functions, a list of strings needs to be given to the
:attr:`Tally.scores` attribute. You can score the flux ('flux'), or a reaction
rate ('total', 'fission', etc.). For example, to tally the elastic scattering
rate and the fission neutron production, you'd assign::

  tally.scores = ['elastic', 'nu-fission']

With no further specification, you will get the total elastic scattering rate
and the total fission neutron production. If you want reaction rates for a
particular nuclide or set of nuclides, you can set the :attr:`Tally.nuclides`
attribute to a list of strings indicating which nuclides. The nuclide names
should follow the same :ref:`naming convention <usersguide_naming>` as that used
for material specification. If we wanted the reaction rates only for U235 and
U238 (separately), we'd set::

  tally.nuclides = ['U235', 'U238']

You can also list 'all' as a nuclide which will give you a separate reaction
rate for every nuclide in the model.

The following tables show all valid scores:

Normalization of Tally Results
------------------------------

As described in :ref:`usersguide_scores`, all tally scores are normalized per
source particle simulated. However, for analysis of a given system, we usually
want tally scores in a more natural unit. For example, neutron flux is often
reported in units of particles/cm\ :sup:`2`\ -s. For a fixed source simulation,
it is usually straightforward to convert units if the source rate is known. For
example, if the system being modeled includes a source that is emitting 10\
:sup:`4` neutrons per second, the tally results just need to be multipled by 10\
:sup:`4`. This can either be done manually or using the
:attr:`openmc.Source.strength` attribute.

For a :math:`k`\ -eigenvalue calculation, normalizing tally results is not as
simple because the source rate is not actually known. Instead, we typically know
the system power, :math:`P`, which represents how much energy is deposited per
unit time. Most of this energy originates from fission, but a small percentage
also results from other reactions (e.g., photons emitted from :math:`(n,\gamma)`
reactions). The most rigorous method to normalize tally results is to run a
coupled neutron-photon calculation and tally the ``heating`` score over the
entire system. This score provides the heating rate in units of [eV/source],
which we'll denote :math:`H`. Then, calculate the heating rate in J/source as

.. math::

    H' = 1.602\times10^{-19} \left [ \frac{\text{J}}{\text{eV}} \right ] \cdot H
    \left [\frac{\text{eV}}{\text{source}} \right ].

Dividing the power by the observed heating rate then gives us a normalization
factor that can be applied to other tallies:

.. math::

    f = \frac{P}{H'} = \frac{[\text{J}/\text{s}]}{[\text{J}/\text{source}]} =
    \left [ \frac{\text{source}}{\text{s}} \right ].

With this normalization factor, we can then get the flux in typical units:

.. math::

    \phi' = \frac{\phi}{fV} = \frac{[\text{particle-cm}/\text{source}]}
    {[\text{source}/\text{s}][\text{cm}^3]} = \left [
    \frac{\text{particle}}{\text{cm}^2\cdot\text{s}} \right ]

There are several slight variations on this procedure:

- Run a neutron-only calculation and estimate the total heating using the
  ``heating-local`` score (this requires that your nuclear data has local
  heating data available, such as in the official data library at
  https://openmc.org. See :ref:`methods_heating` for more information.)
- Run a neutron-only calculation and use the ``kappa-fission`` or
  ``fission-q-recoverable`` scores along with an estimate of the extra heating
  due to neutron capture reactions.
- Calculate the overall fission rate and then used a fixed Q value to estimate
  the heating rate.

Note that the only difference between these and the above procedures is in how
:math:`H'` is estimated.
