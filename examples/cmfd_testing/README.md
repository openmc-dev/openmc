Run `python generate_all_tests.py -r` to generate and run all test cases

To run CMFD on 2D BEAVRS input files using Fortran, run `openmc` in `./2d-beavrs/fortran/`

To run CMFD on 2D BEAVRS input files using C API with vectorized numpy functions,
run `python run_openmc_cmfd.py` in `./2d-beavrs/python-vec/`

To run CMFD on 2D BEAVRS input files using C API with non-vectorized functions,
run `python run_openmc_cmfd.py` in `./2d-beavrs/python-unvec/`
