    "Materials in OpenMC are defined as a set of nuclides with specified atom/weight fractions. To begin, we will create a material by making an instance of the `Material` class. In OpenMC, many objects, including materials, are identified by a \"unique ID\" that is simply just a positive integer. These IDs are used when exporting XML files that the solver reads in. They also appear in the output and can be used for identification. Since an integer ID is not very useful by itself, you can also give a material a `name` as well."

    "At this point, we have three materials defined, exported to XML, and ready to be used in our model. To finish our model, we need to define the geometric arrangement of materials. OpenMC represents physical volumes using constructive solid geometry (CSG), also known as combinatorial geometry. The object that allows us to assign a material to a region of space is called a `Cell` (same concept in MCNP, for those familiar). In order to define a region that we can assign to a cell, we must first define surfaces which bound the region. A *surface* is a locus of zeros of a function of Cartesian coordinates $x$, $y$, and $z$, e.g.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A plane perpendicular to the x axis: $x - x_0 = 0$\n",

    "- A sphere: $(x - x_0)^2 + (y - y_0)^2 + (z - z_0)^2 - R^2 = 0$\n",

    "Between those three classes of surfaces (planes, cylinders, spheres), one can construct a wide variety of models. It is also possible to define cones and general second-order surfaces (tori are not currently supported).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that defining a surface is not sufficient to specify a volume -- in order to define an actual volume, one must reference the half-space of a surface. A surface *half-space* is the region whose points satisfy a positive or negative inequality of the surface equation. For example, for a sphere of radius one centered at the origin, the surface equation is $f(x,y,z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 1 = 0$. Thus, we say that the negative half-space of the sphere, is defined as the collection of points satisfying $f(x,y,z) < 0$, which one can reason is the inside of the sphere. Conversely, the positive half-space of the sphere would correspond to all points outside of the sphere.\n",

There is also a built-in plotter in the Fortran codebase that is much faster than the Python plotter and has more options. The interface looks somewhat similar to the `Universe.plot()` method. Instead though, we create `Plot` instances, assign them to a `Plots` collection, export it to XML, and then run OpenMC in geometry plotting mode. As an example, let's specify that we want the plot to be colored by material (rather than by cell) and we assign yellow to fuel and blue to water."
