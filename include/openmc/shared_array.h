// This container is an array that is capable of being appended to in an
// thread safe manner by use of atomics. It only provides protection for the
// use cases currently present in OpenMC. Namely, it covers the scenario where
// multiple threads are appending to an array, but no threads are reading from
// or operating on it in any other way at the same time. Multiple threads can
// call the thread_safe_append() function concurrently and store data to the
// object at the index returned from thread_safe_append() safely, but no other
// operations are protected.

  //! elements.

  //! space for

  // Methods and Accessors

  //! Return a reference to the element at specified location i. No bounds
  //! checking is performed.

  //! Increase the size of the container by one and append value to the
  //! array. Returns an index to the element of the array written to. Also
  //! tests to enforce that the append operation does not read off the end
  //! of the array. In the event that this does happen, set the size to be
  //! equal to the capacity and return -1.
  //
  //! \value The value of the element to append
  //! \return The index in the array written to. In the event that this
  //! index would be greater than what was allocated for the container,
  //! return -1.
