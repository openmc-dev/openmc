    Parameters
    ----------
    func : callable
        Function to use to get new compositions. Expected to have the
        signature ``func(A, n0, t) -> n1``
    chain : openmc.deplete.Chain
        Depletion chain
    x : list of numpy.ndarray
        Atom number vectors for each material
    rates : openmc.deplete.ReactionRates
        Reaction rates (from transport operator)
    dt : float
        Time in [s] to deplete for
    maxtrix_func : callable, optional
        Function to form the depletion matrix after calling
        ``matrix_func(chain, rates, fission_yields)``, where
        ``fission_yields = {parent: {product: yield_frac}}``
        Expected to return the depletion matrix required by
        ``func``
    msr : openmc.deplete.MsrContinuous, Optional
        Introduce removal rate coefficients for selected nuclides as a
        subtractive term to the Bateman equations, defined as
        :math:`\epsilon_i \lambda_i n_i`, where:
        * :math: `epsilon_i` is the removal efficiency for the nuclide i
        * :math: `lambda_i` is the removal rate coefficient for the nuclide i,
            defined as :math: `\lambda_i = \frac{1}{T_{cyc,i}}`, where
            * :math: `T_{cyc_i}` is the cycle time for the nuclide i
        * :math: `n_i` is the nuclide i.
        :math: `epsilon_i` and :math: `lambda_i` are combined together in one
        single user-defined parameter, simply referred as removal rate with
        units [1/sec].
        The function to form the removal rates matrix is:
        ``map(chain.form_rr_term, repeat(msr), msr.burn_mats)``.
        If the system contains only one depletable material, removed nuclides
        cannot be accounted for afterwards.
        In case one wants to keep track of the removed nuclides, a second
        depletable material can be defined and the respective Bateman equations
        can be coupled.
        The removal rates matrix (or transfer matrix in this case) for the
        second mateerial can be coupled together with the Bateaman matrix of the
        fisrt material in one single matrix.
        The function to form the transfer matrix is:
        ``map(chain.form_rr_term, repeat(msr), msr.index_transfer)``

    Returns
    -------
    x_result : list of numpy.ndarray
        Updated atom number vectors for each material
