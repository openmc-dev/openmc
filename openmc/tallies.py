        This method constructs a Pandas DataFrame object for the Tally data

        This capability has been tested for Pandas >=0.13.1. However, it is
        recommended to use v0.16 or newer versions of Pandas since this method
        uses the Multi-index Pandas feature.

        Parameters
        ----------
        filters : bool
            Include columns with filter bin information (default is True).
        nuclides : bool
            Include columns with nuclide bin information (default is True).
        scores : bool
            Include columns with score bin information (default is True).
        summary : None or Summary
            An optional Summary object to be used to construct columns for
            distribcell tally filters (default is None). The geometric
            information in the Summary object is embedded into a Multi-index
            column with a geometric "path" to each distribcell intance.

        The tally data in OpenMC is stored as a 3D array with the dimensions

        the number of bins and strides for each filter to index into the first
        (filter) dimension.

        This builds and returns a reshaped version of the tally data array with
        unique dimensions corresponding to each tally filter. For example,
        suppose this tally has arrays of data with shape (8,5,5) corresponding
        to two filters (2 and 4 bins, respectively), five nuclides and five
        scores. This method will return a version of the data array with the

        This method builds a new tally with data that is the product of
        this tally's data and that from the other tally or scalar value. If the
        filters, scores and nuclides in the two tallies are not the same, then
        they are combined in all possible ways in the new derived tally.

        Uncertainty propagation is used to compute the standard deviation
        for the new tally's data. It is important to note that this makes
        the assumption that the tally data is independently distributed.
        In most use cases, this is *not* true and may lead to under-prediction
        of the uncertainty. The uncertainty propagation model is from the
