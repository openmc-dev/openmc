        The tally data in OpenMC is stored as a 3D array with the dimensions
        corresponding to filters, nuclides and scores. As a result, tally data
        can be opaque for a user to directly index (i.e., without use of
        :meth:`openmc.Tally.get_values`) since one must know how to properly use
        the number of bins and strides for each filter to index into the first
        (filter) dimension.

        This builds and returns a reshaped version of the tally data array with
        unique dimensions corresponding to each tally filter. For example,
        suppose this tally has arrays of data with shape (8,5,5) corresponding
        to two filters (2 and 4 bins, respectively), five nuclides and five
        scores. This method will return a version of the data array with the
        with a new shape of (2,4,5,5) such that the first two dimensions
        correspond directly to the two filters with two and four bins.

        Parameters
        ----------
        value : str
            A string for the type of value to return  - 'mean' (default),

        This is a helper method for the tally arithmetic operator overloaded
        methods. It is called a "hybrid product" because it performs a
        combination of tensor (or Kronecker) and entrywise (or Hadamard)
        products. The filters from both tallies are combined using an entrywise
        (or Hadamard) product on matching filters. By default, if all nuclides
        are identical in the two tallies, the entrywise product is performed
        across nuclides; else the tensor product is performed. By default, if
        all scores are identical in the two tallies, the entrywise product is
        performed across scores; else the tensor product is performed. Users
        can also call the method explicitly and specify the desired product.

        specified in the input parameters.

        Parameters
        ----------
        scores : list of str
            A list of one or more score strings to average across
            (e.g., ['absorption', 'nu-fission']; default is [])
        filter_type : openmc.FilterMeta
            Type of the filter, e.g. MeshFilter
        filter_bins : Iterable of int or tuple
            A list of the filter bins corresponding to the filter_type parameter
            Each bin in the list is the integer ID for 'material', 'surface',
            'cell', 'cellborn', and 'universe' Filters. Each bin is an integer
            for the cell instance ID for 'distribcell' Filters. Each bin is a
            2-tuple of floats for 'energy' and 'energyout' filters corresponding
            to the energy boundaries of the bin of interest. Each bin is an
            (x,y,z) 3-tuple for 'mesh' filters corresponding to the mesh cell of
            interest.
        nuclides : list of str
            A list of nuclide name strings to average across
            (e.g., ['U235', 'U238']; default is [])
        remove_filter : bool
            If a filter is being averaged over, this bool indicates whether to
            remove that filter in the returned tally. Default is False.

        Returns
        -------
