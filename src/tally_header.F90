! TALLYMAPELEMENT gives an index to a tally which is to be scored and the

! TALLYMAP contains a list of pairs of indices to tallies and the corresponding
! bin for a given filter. There is one TallyMap for each mappable filter
! type. The items array is as long as the corresponding array for that filter,
! e.g. for tally_maps(FILTER_CELL), items is n_cells long.

! TALLYFILTER describes a filter that limits what events score to a tally. For
