# This program takes OpenMC statepoint binary files and creates a variety of
# outputs from them which should provide the user with an idea of the
# convergence behavior of all the tallies and filters defined by the user in
# tallies.xml.  The program can directly plot the value and errors of each
# tally, filter, score combination; it can save these plots to a file; and 
# it can also save the data used in these plots to a CSV file for importing in
# to other plotting packages such as Excel, gnuplot, MathGL, or Veusz.

# To use the program, run this program from the working directory of the openMC
# problem to analyze.  

# The USER OPTIONS block below provides four options for the user to set:
# fileType, printxs, showImg, and savetoCSV.  See the options block for more 
# information.
